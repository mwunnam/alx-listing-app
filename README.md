# About the Project
The ALX Listing App project aims to scaffold and lay the foundational structure for a modern Airbnb clone. This initial milestone focuses on setting up a well-organized and scalable codebase using Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and ESLint. By establishing a clean folder structure, reusable components, and adhering to best practices, the project ensures a solid starting point for building a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly property listing page.

## **Learning Objectives**
This milestone is designed for professional developers to strengthen their expertise in modern web application development. By completing this milestone, learners will:

* Gain hands-on experience scaffolding a Next.js project tailored for production readiness.
* Implement TypeScript for type safety and reusable interfaces to enhance code maintainability and robustness.
* Configure TailwindCSS for building responsive, accessible, and visually appealing UI components.
* Structure a Next.js project following industry-standard best practices, ensuring scalability and readability.
* Create foundational reusable components and organize assets effectively for real-world applications.


## **Requirements**
To successfully complete this milestone, learners must meet the following prerequisites:

* Basic knowledge of Next.js, React, and TypeScript.
* Familiarity with TailwindCSS and modern styling techniques.
* Understanding of ESLint and its role in maintaining code quality.
* Proficiency in organizing and structuring projects for scalability.


## **Technical Requirements**:

* Next.js version 13+.
* Node.js version 16+ installed locally.
* Text editor (e.g., VS Code) with TypeScript and TailwindCSS extensions installed.

## **Key Highlights**
1. **Project Setup**:

Scaffold a Next.js application named alx-listing-app with TypeScript, ESLint, and TailwindCSS enabled.
Configure TailwindCSS using a minimal and clean configuration (tailwind.config.js and globals.css).

2. **Folder Structure and Reusability**:

Establish a clean folder structure, including directories for components/, interfaces/, constants/, and public/assets/.
Create reusable components such as Card and Button for modularity and scalability.

3. **TypeScript Integration**:

Define TypeScript interfaces (CardProps, ButtonProps, etc.) in interfaces/index.ts to ensure type safety and code consistency.

4. **Asset Management**:

Organize assets, including images and SVGs, under public/assets/ for easy access and maintenance.
